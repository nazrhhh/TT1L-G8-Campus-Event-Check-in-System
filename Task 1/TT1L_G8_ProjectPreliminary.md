# Project Preliminary

## 1. PROJECT VISION

This project involves creating a digital check-in system for campus
events that integrates with both the university\'s student
identification database and payment processing system. The platform
streamlines event attendance tracking while handling ticket verification
and on-site purchases.

## 2. PROJECT SCOPE

The **Campus Event Check-In System** is a centralized digital platform
designed to streamline the registration, payment, and attendance process
for campus events. The system serves three main user roles which are
**Student, Event Organizer, and University Admin**, with an integrated
**Payment Gateway** to manage all financial transactions securely. Each
role has distinct functions and access privileges to ensure a smooth and
organized event experience.

**Core Functionalities:**

- **User Management:** Enables account registration, login, and role-based access. Profiles are securely maintained for each user.

- **Event Registration and Attendance:** Students can view upcoming events, register for them, and check in using their student ID. Real-time identity verification is done using university records.

- **Payment Integration:** Students can make payments for event tickets or on-site purchases. The system verifies and processes payments securely via a payment gateway, and University Admin can resolve any payment issues.

- **Event Creation and Approval:** Event organizers can submit event requests, set event details, and manage event logistics. Events must be reviewed and approved by University Admins before going online.

- **Communication and Notification:** Event Organizers and University Admins can send announcements or system-generated notifications (e.g., registration confirmation, payment success, and reminders) to students.

- **Attendance Management:** Event Organizers can view and manage the list of attendees and generate attendance reports after each event.

- **System Monitoring and Reporting:** University Admins can monitor overall system activity, generate system-wide reports, and manage user accounts and roles.

## 3. PROJECT GOALS

**General Goals:**
- To provide a fast and secure way for students to check in to events using their student ID.
- To allow students to easily register for events, receive confirmations, and make online payments.
- To help event organizers manage everything in one place, from event setup to attendance tracking.
- To support university admins in monitoring system activity, approving events, and solving payment problems.
- To create clear and useful reports about event attendance, payments, and student engagement.

**Technical Goals:**
1. **Efficiency:** Reduce check-in time compared to manual processes
2. **Integration:** Connect with existing university student ID and payment systems
3. **Accuracy:** Achieve high accuracy in attendance tracking and payments
4. **Usability:** Create an intuitive interface requiring minimal training
