**1. Documentation and Justification for Kano Model**

This elicitation plan leverages the Kano Model to categorize system requirements for the Campus Event Check-in System based on how they influence stakeholder satisfaction. The system serves three main user roles—Students, Event Organizers, and University Admins—and integrates with existing student identification and payment processing systems.

The Kano Model helps us distinguish:
- Basic Needs (Dissatisfiers): Essential requirements that cause dissatisfaction if missing.
- Performance Needs (Satisfiers): Directly impact user satisfaction in proportion to implementation quality.
- Excitement Needs (Delighters): Unexpected features that increase satisfaction when present but are not expected.

Given the variety of stakeholder roles and expectations, the Kano Model ensures we meet basic system expectations while also identifying high-impact improvements.

**2. Justification for Selected Elicitation Techniques**

To gather well-rounded requirements, we selected a combination of elicitation techniques tailored to different stakeholder groups and system roles:
- Questionnaires: Efficient for gathering quantifiable data from large student populations.
- Interviews: Capture detailed feedback from organizers, finance, and IT staff about workflows and system needs.
- Workshops: Facilitate collaborative discussion among stakeholder groups to refine requirements.
- Document Analysis: Validates integration points with student ID and payment databases.
- Brainstorming: Generates innovative features like loyalty rewards and calendar sync.
These techniques ensure the system meets both functional requirements and usability expectations.

**3. Sample Stakeholder Questionnaire**

1. How often do you participate in campus events?
2. What methods do you currently use to register for events?
3. Would you prefer a digital check-in using your Student ID or QR code?
4. What types of payment methods do you use/prefer (e-wallet, card, bank transfer)?
5. Would receiving automated reminders or confirmations improve your event experience?
6. What difficulties have you experienced with event check-ins or payments in the past?
7. What features would make the system easier or more engaging for you?
8. Would you find loyalty points or rewards useful for frequent participation?
9. What are your privacy or data concerns using a centralized check-in system?
10. Is there any additional feedback you'd like to share about your expectations?
