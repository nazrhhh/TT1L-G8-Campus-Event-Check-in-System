**1. Documentation and Justification for Kano Model**

This elicitation plan leverages the Kano Model to categorize system requirements for the Campus Event Check-in System based on how they influence stakeholder satisfaction. The system serves three main user roles—Students, Event Organizers, and University Admins—and integrates with existing student identification and payment processing systems.

The Kano Model helps us distinguish:
- Basic Needs (Dissatisfiers): Essential requirements that cause dissatisfaction if missing.
- Performance Needs (Satisfiers): Directly impact user satisfaction in proportion to implementation quality.
- Excitement Needs (Delighters): Unexpected features that increase satisfaction when present but are not expected.

Given the variety of stakeholder roles and expectations, the Kano Model ensures we meet basic system expectations while also identifying high-impact improvements. Each requirement gathered is systematically categorized under the Kano Model to prioritize stakeholder needs, ensuring that the system addresses foundational expectations while identifying high-impact features that delight users. This model allows clear traceability from elicited feedback to categorized requirements, enabling the development team to prioritize implementation in a structured manner.

**2. Justification for Selected Elicitation Techniques**

This elicitation plan focuses on two carefully selected techniques: questionnaires and brainstorming. These were chosen based on their suitability for the project's goals and the accessibility of our stakeholders.

- Questionnaires: These are distributed to students, event organizers, and university admins. They are effective for capturing structured, large-scale feedback quickly. Predefined questions ensure clarity and standardization, making it easier to analyze patterns and prioritize features within the Kano model.
- Brainstorming: Conducted within the team and optionally with select stakeholders, this method encourages open-ended idea generation for delighter features. It helps uncover innovative functionalities that may not emerge through structured questions.

Together, these two methods provide a balanced combination of structured data and creative input, enabling comprehensive requirement elicitation aligned with the Kano classification.

**3. Sample Stakeholder Questionnaire**

1. How often do you participate in campus events?
2. What methods do you currently use to register for events?
3. Would you prefer a digital check-in using your Student ID or QR code?
4. What types of payment methods do you use/prefer (e-wallet, card, bank transfer)?
5. Would receiving automated reminders or confirmations improve your event experience?
6. What difficulties have you experienced with event check-ins or payments in the past?
7. What features would make the system easier or more engaging for you?
8. Would you find loyalty points or rewards useful for frequent participation?
9. What are your privacy or data concerns using a centralized check-in system?
10. Is there any additional feedback you'd like to share about your expectations?
